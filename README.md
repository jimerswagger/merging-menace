# Merging Menace
A High Speed Infinite Runner where you are chased by the Pentagon.
A Game created in Unity by Jimmy Saldana

Swerve and merge your way across interstate highways to a life of solitude as the Pentagon tries to take you down with missiles and impromptu highway lane closures.

The ultimate goal is to survive for as long as you can before crashing into another car enough times or being killed by the Pentagon. 
There is also the arcadey goal of getting a hi-score.

The player’s car is always accelerating, however, players can use the standard WASD keys to 
* W - Accelerate Forwards Faster
* S - Slow Down
* A - Merge Left
* D - Merge Right

All to avoid the cars and Pentagon attacks.
